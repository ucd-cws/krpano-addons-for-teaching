Possible errors/problems that might occur during the testing phase

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
uncaught exception: Error in Actionscript. Use a try/catch block to find error.

   This will prevent any calls to the krpano object

   This usually means that the "Always ask" has been checked. So please check "Always allow"
   to stop the above error from happening.

QUESTIONS + TODO

All hotspots will exist in the exported krpano?
Will all hotspots be used in a lecture? (I would assume no.)
After above answered, that means there will need to be some necessary hard-coding to get the positions right.
Thus another file will be "required" that will setup the hotspot grouping so that we know which thing should go where.
Toggle the visibility of the text? OR Remove and Add new text during scene change/hotspot change?


TODO

2.  get pano number, hotspot number and label in "admin mode"
    i.e. i'm in "admin mode", essentially the virtual tour but has power to mouse over a hotspot and get the info described above.
    why? it helps with the labeling and setting up the lectures! ;)
3. Turn off OpenStreetMap Layer on the Bing Maps. only keep cycle map. (Less of a priority)
4. Be aware of the memory usage when a lot of people using the pano.
