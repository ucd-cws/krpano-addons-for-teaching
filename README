TODO

1. Turn off OpenStreetMap Layer on the Bing Maps. only keep cycle map. (Less of a priority)
2. Be aware of the memory usage when a lot of people are using the pano.


NOTES

Individual hotspot names are located in their respective .xml files. They generally have this form 

    <hotspot name="spot0" hview="98.22" vview="0" fovview="90" hcenter="2.4342" vcenter="0.184726" onclick="looktohotspot(get(name),get(view.fovmin),smooth(400,20,100));mainloadpano(31.xml);lookat(get(hview),get(vview),get(fovview));" url="3data/graphics/spots/spot1.png" distorted="true" ath="2.44516" atv="0.195504" width="23" height="24" rx="24.1025" ry="5.14512" rz="-0.823133"/>

Here we can see that the hotspot's name is "spot0" thus spot0 will be recorded into the .json files for the lecture under hotspots > id .

Each pano number is obtained by looking at the name of each .xml files. 
For example: if the base name of your files were 3, then 30.xml would be pano number 0. However, the only file that is not actually a pano is 3.xml since this is the .xml file that performs all the pano set ups and then loads the zeroth pano, pano 0. 

The pano number should be recorded under pano_num in the .json file.
